This is a cropped and resized subset of [FFHQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset). The image resolutions are the same as [SDXL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01952) mixed-aspect ratio finetuning as indicated in Appendix I. 

Enumeration of images is the same as FFHQ. This enables usage of supporting datasets/libraries such as [DCGM/ffhq-features-dataset](https://github.com/DCGM/ffhq-features-dataset)



More information of the images can be obtained via [ffhq-dataset-v2.json](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset?tab=readme-ov-file#overview) provided by FFHQ.
